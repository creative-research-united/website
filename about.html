    <h2>What we are?</h2>

    Creative Research United was formed in early 2016 and is based in London. We are a hybrid group, at the intersection of Art, Technology, Culture and the Environment. We work on creating tools, public displays focusing on this intersection, and solving complex data problems.

    We are a combination of people made up of Data Scientists, Engineers, Designers and UX experts.
